libthekogans_make_core is the heart of thekogans_make. it's built in to
a shared library to be used by thekogans_make and plugins made for it.

please take note of the library name; make_core. that underscore gives
away the fact that make_core is a sub-project of make. because of this,
when cloning make_core, either clone make or mkdir make and clone it to
make/core.
